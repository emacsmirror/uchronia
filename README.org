* uchronia.el - Rewrite the minibuffer history

This small unreleased package provides the ~uchronia-mode~ which stores the
history for every minibuffer and completion command. The last recent minibuffer
session can then be restarted using ~uchronia-repeat~. Furthermore one can
select from the list of recent minibuffer sessions using ~uchronia-select~.

Both ~uchronia-repeat~ and ~uchronia-select~ allow to restart the minibuffer
session and edit the historical input, they allow rewriting the history.
Therefore the name [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history][Uchronia]].
